Sensu
============

Dockerfiles for each component and Docker Compose file for setting up a Sensu server.

Installing Docker
-----------------
Follow the instructions on the docker site for your platform.
* [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/)
* [Ubuntu Trusty](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#docker-maintained-package-installation)
* [Ubuntu Precise](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#ubuntu-precise-1204-lts-64-bit)

_I recommend using the Docker maintained repos for Ubuntu and do/will not support boot2docker on OSX_

Installing Docker Compose
-------------------------

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.1.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Clone and Run the Sensu Server
------------------------------

Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/jbrien/sensu-docker.git```

Generate the environment variables and ssl certs for RabbitMQ and Sensu. The ssl certificates and generated in `/usr/local/etc/sensu-docker` on the docker host. Take note of this to be able and distribute the client folder and RabbitMQ password from the sensu.env file for new sensu clients

```
cd sensu-docker
sudo ./setup-sensu-docker.sh generate
sudo docker-compose -f base.yml build
sudo docker-compose -f base.yml up
```

_it's normal to see a rc or console errors and they can safely be ignored._ once the download and build process is done you can run `sudo docker-compose -f base.yml up` to start the cluster. Once up browse to http://[your-server-ip]:3000/ to see the sensu dashboard.

This setup also monitors itself so you should be able to see three docker containers in the client list (the Docker container HOSTNAME is reflected in the IP Address column). Each Redis, RabbitMQ, and Sensu's components being monitored respectively. It's up to you at this point to secure the dashboard if you are going to use this in production.

There is a volume shared from the Sensu server container in `/etc/sensu/conf.d`. Installing new checks to this location can restarting the sensu-server service will load them.

`sudo docker exec -t sensudocker_sensu_1 supervisorctl restart sensu-server`

Load Sensu with Metrics
-----------------------

There is a metric configuration that adds [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com) and [Grafana](http://www.grafana.org) to the base stack. The Grafana dashboard is available at http://[your-server-ip]:4000 and InfluxDB's dashboard is available at http://[your-server-ip]:8083.

```
sudo docker-compose -f metrics.yml build
sudo docker-compose -f metrics.yml up
```

There is an environment variable for Grafana's dashboard to be able to connect to InfluxDB, `INFLUXDB_ENV_IP`, that defaults to `localhost`. Grafana needs a public IP or URL (without the http://) for InfluxDB to make queries with it's API.

```
INFLUXDB_EXT_IP=www.example.com sudo docker-compose -f metrics.yml up
```

The root password for InfluxDB is available in the `/usr/local/etc/sensu-docker/sensu.env` as is the sensu user used by Sensu to push its time series to InfluxDB.

Exploring the Metric Series
---------------------------

After a few minutes you can log into InfluxDB with the sensu username and password and using `sensu` as the database (The sensu user is restricted to just seeing the data in the sensu database and can not log in otherwise). The data is InfluxDB is disposable; so each restart of the InfluxDB container will destroy any historical data.

* Select `Explore Data` in the header
* putting `list series` in the Query fields will show all the metric series being collected
* putting `select * from /.*/ limit 5` will show & graph the last five results for each of the time series

Other Queries working out of the box

```
select * from cpu_total_user where host =~ /sensu-server/
select mean(value) from cpu_total_idle group by time(30s) where time > now() - 1d and host =~ /sensu-server/
select mean(value) from load_avg_five
```

Development
-----------

There is a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) file provided in this repository that will install both Docker and Docker Compose. All necessary ports are setup for development and defaults will work as expected. The contents of this repository are located in `/vagrant` when the VM come up.

Connecting a new Ubuntu Client
-----------------------

Copy the `/usr/local/etc/sensu-docker/client` folder from the Docker host (_generated when setting up the server_) to the client along with the `install_client.sh` script. If you no longer have this folder you will need to replace the certs on the server after running the script again.

make sure you have `wget` installed and run install_client.sh

```
sudo ./install_client.sh
```
Copy the client `cert.pem` and `key.pem` from the `/usr/local/etc/sensu-docker/client` folder on the Docker host.
Modify the client config /etc/sensu/config.json with the necessary information.

Replace `%RABBITMQ_ADDR_OR_IP%` with the address for RabbitMQ from the docker-compose launch.
Replace `%RABBITMQ_PASSWD%` with the password for RabbitMQ found in the /usr/local/etc/sensu-docker/sensu.env file.
Replace `%NODE_NAME%` with a unique name to identify this client.
Replace `%HOSTNAME%` with the hostname or IP of the client.

Adjust subscriptions to meet your needs

```
{
  "rabbitmq": {
    "ssl": {
      "cert_chain_file": "/etc/sensu/ssl/cert.pem",
      "private_key_file": "/etc/sensu/ssl/key.pem"
    },
    "port": 5671,
    "host": "%RABBITMQ_ADDR_OR_IP%",
    "user": "sensu",
    "password": "%RABBITMQ_PASSWD%",
    "vhost": "/sensu"
  },
  "client": {
    "name": "%NODE_NAME%",
    "address": "%HOSTNAME%",
    "subscriptions": [ "default" ]
  }
}
```

In Progress & Todo
------------------

* Data persistance where it makes sense
* Client install script for Yum based distros
* Documentation for running in production
* Documentation to scale InfluxDB / RabbitMQ (Docker Swarm?, Kubernetes?, CoreOS?)
